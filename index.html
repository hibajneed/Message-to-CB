            <p> 
                Heyyy CodeBrave team..

                <br> 
                Here's a message I wrote for you
                <br>
                <button onclick="myfunction()"> Press Me To Oppen</button>
            </p>
        </div>


        <div id="second-page">
            <h2>print("Hello")</h2>
            <p>
            
                First let me introduce my self, I'm Hiba, a scholar in 
                CodeBrave Coding and Web development program (2024-2025)
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    This letter is written with sincere feelings.
                    <br> 
                    Through its words, I tried to convey my feelings and tell you
                     - through this program - what I have gained, what I aspire to, and to extend my thanks to you guys.                   <br>
                    <br>
                     Maybe, the goals of this program may have been educational
                    and developmental, but they far exceeded that for me and perhaps most of my colleagues
                    <br>
            </p>

            <h2>print("What did I learned?")</h2>
            <p>
                This program affect me more than I expected and even more than you think.. 
                I mean educationaly, personally, socially and maybe more.
                <br>
                In addition to the field of programming and website development, 
                which I delved into and loved more, 
                <br>
                I learned many other things through the 
                lessons I attended, my teacher Razan, my classmates, my colleagues...
                <ul id="points">
                    <li> I started out with almost no experience. Today and after about 4 months, I have really learned a lot</li>
                    <li> I began to see websites from a programming perspective. I used to see everything ready and visible. 
                        Now I know the role of programming, how it works, and I can apply it as well !!</li>
                    <li> I learned a lot of patience </li>
                    <li> It is normal to make mistakes.. It is especially wonderful once we are able to solve them</li>
                    <li> Problems are not obstacles.. but opportunities to learn new things</li>
                    <li> My English has improved a lot.. I practice it more than I used to</li>
                    <li> I met wonderful people</li>
                    <li> Self learning is possible, it teaches alot and not boring</li>
                    <li> Of course this is not everything...</li>
            
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>print("What About Later?")</h2>
                <p>
                    By later, I mean starting from when I reach the end of the program and what follows.. 
                    <br>
                    It will not actually be an end, but rather a beginning to build on what I have gained, 
                    and even give it to others if I have the opportunity, God willing.
                    <br>
                    I consider this a small part of returning the favor and thanking you, 
                    knowing that you deserve a lot
                    <br>

                </p>

            <h2>print("Last But Not Least..")</h2>
            <p>
                How hard it is to express my pleasure and glad to be with you.. 
                <br>
                My participation with you was one of the best things that happened to me 
                <br>
                I really hope everyone of our age who deserves.. To be with you and have the opportunity to participate, learn and benefit.  
                      
            </p>
